# Early Prediction of Sepsis

Research Aim: This project aims to predict sepsis early, before the clinical prediction of sepsis.

Challenges
Limited Raw Features: Only 40 features are in the datasets.
High Missing rates: Most of the missing rates of the features are greater than 90%.
Variable-Length Inputs: The number of records we can use is different at each hour.
Label imbalance: Only 7.26% of the patients finally have sepsis (1.8% of the records).

Contribution:
Address imbalance datasets & variable-length time series issues
Improve Clinical outctions
Model Interpretability
